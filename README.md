# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering

This project applies K-means clustering to segment mall customers into distinct groups based on features such as age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer behavior and support data-driven marketing strategies. Using visualizations and cluster analysis, we can identify different consumer profiles to help businesses better target their services.
